To be able to use our software you have to first run each microservice, Services need to be run in parallel (in different terminals) :

Run movie service : cd ./UE-AD-A1-MIXTE/movie python movie.py

Run showtime service : cd ./UE-AD-A1-MIXTE/showtime python showtime.py

Run booking service : cd ./UE-AD-A1-MIXTE/booking python bookingServer.py

Run user service : cd ./UE-AD-A1-MIXTE/user python user.py

You can then use user endpoints from http://127.0.0.1:3203/ Don't hesitate to use http://127.0.0.1:3203/help or check out the OpenAPI documentation to know about each endpoint !
